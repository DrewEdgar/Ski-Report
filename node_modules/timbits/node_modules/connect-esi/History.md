0.0.1 / 2011-08-08
==================

  * Initial release

0.0.2 / 2011-08-09
==================

  * Process ESI based on content-type
  * If no content-type exists in response.header, assign content-type 'text/plain'

0.0.3 / 2011-08-12
==================

  * Refactored all of connect-esi so that methods contained inside of processESI could be used individually for testing (searchESI, fetchESI, subESI)
  * Fixed issue where the response would always have http status code of 200
  * Fixed issue where regex was too greedy when replacing esi tags
  * Rewrote all regex for searching and replacing esi tags
  * Removed displayData method in processESI
  * Added hostname and port as variables within processESI for fetchESI requests
  * Added catch for http.get error in fetchESI. Will return http status code of 500 along with the error message
  * Implemented kitkat testing framework

0.0.4 / 2011-08-16
==================

  * Implemented the following esi variables (as described here http://www.w3.org/TR/esi-lang):
    - $(HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE)
    - $(HTTP_COOKIE{cookie})
    - $(HTTP_HEADER{header})
    - $(HTTP_HOST)
    - $(HTTP_REFERER)
    - $(HTTP_USER_AGENT)
    - $(QUERY_STRING{parameter})
    - $(QUERY_STRING)
  * Added testing for new esi variables

0.1.0 / 2011-08-18
==================

  * ESI variables can now make use of default values
  * Fixed issue where $ needed to be escaped on replace
  * Implemented styout for logging
  * First 'stable' release

0.1.1 / 2011-08-19
==================

  * Fixed bug where res.end would potentially never be called
  * Cleaned up logging statements

0.1.2 / 2011-08-23
==================

  * Fixed bug where the content-length in header was incorrectly calculated if the content contained utf-8 characters

0.1.3 / 2011-08-25
==================

  * In res.write, content will be processed for ESIs if the header type contains either 'text', 'xml', or 'octet-stream'
  * In header, will now use 'transfer-encoding' = 'chunked' instead of 'content-length' (content-length had issues with large text files > 40960 bytes)
  * If no ESIs are found, send back original, unmodified data to res.write callback (previously returned data.toString())

0.1.4 / 2011-09-26
=================

  * Fix bug if res.end called with data that is not content type of text/xml/octet-stream
  * Added ability to override esi parsing by including esi=false in the url request

0.1.5 / 2011-10-03
=================

  * Update examples

0.1.6 / 2011-11-11
=================

  * uri encode the result of lookupESIvar by default

0.1.7 / 2011-11-21
=================

  * Fixed issue where duplicate esi tags would result in res.write being called after the page has already been written
  * Removed duplicate esi tags from searchESI method (prevents requesting same resource more than once)

0.1.8 / 2012-04-10
=================
  * Added ability to detect whether request is from a client that can process ESI
  * Added ability to pass options to setupESI
  * options.esi can be either auto, true, false
  * If client can process ESI and options.esi set to auto OR if options.esi set to false, then output ESI tag instead of processing

0.2.0 / 2012-04-11
=================
  * Filter/hook code refactor
  * Added header-transfer-method option to setupESI (for transfer-encoding / content-length)
  * Removed content-length from header if transfer-encoding used
  * In res.write, will now convert chunks into string if necessary (for ESI processing)

0.2.1 / 2012-04-12
=================
  * Only modifies res.write and res.end if ESI handling is enabled
  * Removed header-transfer-method option to setupESI since removing 'content-length' from the header appears to recalculate the content-length and set transfer-encoding: chunked
