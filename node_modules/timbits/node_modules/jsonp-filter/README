# jsonp-filter
jsonp filter for the express framework.

## Introduction

The purpose of jsonp-filter is to provide an option to serve the response as jsonp (callback with string input).

## Installing

Just grab [node.js](http://nodejs.org/#download) and [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm) and you're set:

	npm install jsonp-filter
	
Note that jsonp-filter was developed using [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org).

## Using

To utilize jsonp-filter, simply require it and then have the express server use the setupJSONP() method. To make sure that no other modules conflict with jsonp-filter, it should be used by the server before other 'use' methods.

	jsonp = require 'jsonp-filter'

	server.use jsonp.setupJSONP()

After jsonp-filter has been setup, responses can now be served as jsonp by specifying json=true&callback=callbackname as query string parameters.
